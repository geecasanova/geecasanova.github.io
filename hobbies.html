        <h3>Coding/Scripting</h3>
        <p>Coding, I started coding at the age of 12 when I first got my gaming desktop.
            I use to code for roblox and make my own games which I fell in love doing.
            If you want to code on roblox you would have to learn their language called
            LUA. roblox LUA wasn't too far off from javascript but it was much easier.
            I use to make basic games on roblox that wasn't really advertising but 
            was fun for me. Coding and Scripting pretty much been in my life for a 
            very long time because thats what I want to do in my future job, and 
            what is what i'm doing for my carrer classes.
