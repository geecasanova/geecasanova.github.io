	<p>
	My name is Greg Janvier, I was born in Queens, New York where I lived for 12 years until I moved into Ohio where I been currently staying for 4 years now. 
	In my 12 years in New York I grew up playing basketball eventually I got good at it and I was going to play on my school team before my dreams was cut short because we had to move. 
	My family moved because of bad conditioning events, so I became adjusted to the normal ohio life which I find chill and laid back.
